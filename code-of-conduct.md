## our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a
harassment‑free experience for everyone.

## our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the project or its community in public
spaces.

## enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the maintainer at **[email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com)**.  All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Further details of enforcement policies may be posted separately.
