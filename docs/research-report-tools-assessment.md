# Lyme Disease Risk Assessment Models and Tools in the U.S.

Lyme disease risk assessment has been approached through a variety of scientific models and public health tools. Broadly, these fall into two categories: **geographic risk models** (mapping where and when Lyme disease risk is highest) and **bite-level risk predictors** (estimating the probability that a specific tick bite will cause infection). Below is a comprehensive review of published models and dashboards integrating geographic data (county-level or finer) and/or individual tick bite risk factors. We evaluate whether any existing systems already calculate per-bite infection probabilities or merge ecological surveillance data with personal exposure information. The methodological strengths and limitations of each approach are discussed, and we consider whether a proposed Bayesian geospatial per-bite risk model would be a novel contribution or overlap with existing work.

## Geographic Data-Driven Risk Models and Dashboards

**Public Health Surveillance Maps (Incidence and Tick Distribution):** Public health agencies have developed maps to display where Lyme disease and its tick vectors are most prevalent. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains up-to-date surveillance maps of reported Lyme disease cases by county, illustrating how incidence has expanded over time. CDC also provides interactive county-level tick surveillance maps. These show where different tick species (like the Lyme-transmitting *Ixodes* ticks) have been found and where ticks have tested positive for *Borrelia burgdorferi* (the Lyme bacterium). For example, CDC’s **Tick Surveillance Data** site (launched 2024) lets users explore county-level data for blacklegged tick presence and the geographic distribution of infected ticks. Such tools integrate geographic and ecological data, highlighting regional risk patterns (e.g. clusters of infected ticks in the Northeast and Upper Midwest). A limitation, however, is that they focus on environmental risk indicators (tick occurrence and infection rates) rather than translating those into a personal probability of disease. They inform where risk is high but do not compute an individual’s infection chance from a given exposure.

**Johns Hopkins Lyme & Tickborne Disease Dashboard:** Launched in 2021, this academic-public health collaboration created a comprehensive online dashboard to visualize tickborne disease data geographically. The Johns Hopkins dashboard compiles multiple data layers – human Lyme case incidence by county, tick vector distributions, and environmental factors – in one interactive map interface. This “one-stop” geospatial tool applies a **One Health** perspective by contextualizing human case data with environmental and social variables. For instance, users can overlay Lyme case rates with forest cover or deer population density. The strength of this approach is its integrative visualization: it harnesses geography to communicate risk and allows researchers or the public to see localized hotspots. A noted limitation is that, while it aggregates surveillance data and risk factors, it is primarily descriptive. It doesn’t provide a quantitative risk calculator for individuals, but it fills a gap by unifying diverse datasets. The developers themselves noted that prior mapping resources were piecemeal and geographically limited (often run by state agencies or universities), and *“none \[before this] brings together various geographic data in a single place”*.

**State-Level Risk Score Maps:** In some cases, state health departments have created their own tools by combining tick surveillance and infection data into a simple regional risk index. For example, the New York State Dept. of Health publishes a **Tick Risk Score by Region** map that rates each region 0–5 for risk of encountering an infected tick. This score is based on tick population monitoring and the proportion of ticks carrying pathogens in each region. Regions like the Finger Lakes and Hudson Valley are categorized as highest risk under this system. The advantage of such a tool is its directness – it gives the public a snapshot of risk in their area in an easy-to-understand score. However, it’s a coarse measure (regional scale, seasonal trends not explicitly shown) and is not individualized beyond “encounter risk.” It doesn’t account for personal behavior or specific exposure scenarios, only the ambient hazard level.

**Canine Seroprevalence Models (Spatial Forecasting):** An innovative scientific model uses domestic dogs as sentinels for Lyme risk. A 2017 PLOS One study by Watson *et al.* built a **Bayesian spatio-temporal model** to forecast *Borrelia* antibody prevalence in dogs across the contiguous U.S.. The model ingested *11.9 million* dog serology test results (2011–2015, county-resolved) and related them to environmental variables like forest cover, temperature, precipitation, and even socio-demographics. By fitting a Bayesian conditional autoregressive model, the authors identified significant geographic risk factors and produced yearly forecasted risk maps. The model showed excellent predictive skill (county-level predictions correlated with observed patterns at r ≈ 0.98). **Strengths:** Huge data scale and rigorous methodology enabled fine-scale risk prediction, and because dogs and humans share tick exposure in similar habitats, these forecasts can flag emerging human Lyme risk areas. For instance, rising dog infection rates in a county may presage Lyme cases in humans there. **Limitations:** Dogs’ exposure might differ from humans (e.g. dogs roam in brush where ticks lurk, and they may be vaccinated for Lyme), so it’s an indirect proxy. Also, this was an academic model – essentially a research prototype. While the data (from the CAPC parasite network) are publicly accessible, translating this into a real-time public **dashboard or tool** for human risk hasn’t fully happened yet (beyond CAPC’s own pet parasite maps). It does, however, demonstrate the power of Bayesian geospatial modeling for Lyme risk and could be adapted for human risk forecasting.

**Other Environmental Niche and Incidence Models:** Numerous peer-reviewed studies have modeled Lyme disease distribution using climatic and ecological predictors. For example, researchers have applied hierarchical Bayesian models to human Lyme case data to identify environmental covariates of high incidence. One recent study (Kulisz *et al.*, 2024) used spatio-temporal Bayesian modeling to link Polish Lyme incidence with forest cover, tick host wildlife density, and climate factors. Similarly, in the U.S., earlier studies (e.g. Chen *et al.*, 2006 in New York) used Bayesian frameworks to smooth incidence rates and capture spatial dependency. These models’ strength is in elucidating broad drivers of Lyme risk (e.g. showing that more forested, deer-rich areas correlate with higher disease rates). They often provide county-level risk maps that can guide public health planning. The limitation is that they stay at the population level – they tell us *where* Lyme risk is high, but not *which particular bite* will result in illness. In summary, geographic models and maps are very useful to identify risk zones and trends over space and time, but they stop short of giving personalized risk estimates. This is where bite-level models come in.

## Per-Bite Infection Risk Prediction Models

While maps can say “you are in a high-risk county,” an individual who finds a tick attached wants to know “what is the chance **this** tick bite gave me Lyme disease?” Several scientific efforts address this by incorporating **tick-level and bite-level factors** – such as tick species, life stage, infection status, and attachment duration – to estimate infection probability for that bite.

**Structured Risk Models for Tick Bites:** A landmark peer-reviewed model by Hofhuis *et al.* (2017, PLoS ONE) quantified how certain bite-specific factors influence Lyme disease outcome. They analyzed over 3,500 tick bites in the Netherlands and applied a structural equation model to predict which bites led to Lyme borreliosis. Key predictors were: (1) the tick’s **engorgement level** (how much blood it took), (2) the **duration of attachment** (as estimated by the patient), and (3) whether the tick tested **PCR-positive for *Borrelia* bacteria**. The overall infection rate in their dataset was 2.6% of tick bites, but the risk ranged widely based on those factors. For example, a minimally engorged tick carried \~1.4% risk, whereas a highly engorged tick carried \~5.5% risk of giving Lyme. Bites from ticks attached <12 hours had \~2.0% risk versus \~5.2% if the tick fed for ≥4 days. If *Borrelia* DNA was actually detected in the tick, the bite’s risk jumped to \~6.7%, compared to \~1.4% if the tick tested negative. Combining worst-case factors (a long-attached, highly engorged tick that was *Borrelia*-positive) yielded an estimated *14.4% probability* of Lyme infection from that single bite. In other words, about 1 in 7 such high-risk bites led to disease in their data. **Strengths:** This model is evidence-based and granular, identifying specific risk multipliers for each factor. It effectively *calculates per-bite probabilities* given particular conditions. **Limitations:** It requires knowing details often unavailable to the average person – e.g. lab testing of the tick for *Borrelia* or accurately estimating how long the tick was attached. Moreover, the study was in Europe (where *Ixodes ricinus* ticks and different Borrelia species circulate), so absolute risk numbers may differ in U.S. contexts. Nonetheless, the qualitative insights likely hold broadly: longer feeding, higher engorgement, and pathogen-positive ticks dramatically raise risk. This kind of model could be adapted as a decision tool (for example, to guide whether post-bite antibiotic prophylaxis is warranted), but to date it remains a published analysis rather than a widely used calculator app.

**Clinical Guidelines and Heuristic Risk Estimates:** Even before formal models, experts had derived rules of thumb for per-bite risk. Infectious disease specialists generally agree that most tick bites **do not** cause Lyme disease – even in endemic areas, the risk per bite is usually a few percent or lower. A classic New England Journal of Medicine article (1992) estimated the probability of Lyme after a recognized deer tick bite to be \~1–5% in Lyme-endemic regions. More recent U.S. data (e.g. from prophylaxis trials) similarly suggest on the order of 2–4% of identified high-risk tick bites result in Lyme infection when no prophylactic antibiotics are given. These probabilities underpin guidelines on tick bite management. For instance, current recommendations (IDSA/CDC) advise a preventive single dose of doxycycline *only* if the bite meets high-risk criteria: the tick was an **Ixodes** (blacklegged) tick, it was likely attached for ≥36 hours, and the local Lyme infection rate in ticks is significant (typically ≥20% infection prevalence). If those conditions are met, the infection risk may exceed \~3–4%, tipping the risk-benefit in favor of antibiotics. If not – for example, a tick attached briefly or a species like dog tick – the risk is deemed too low for prophylaxis. These guidelines essentially embed a simple risk model:

* *Tick species:* Non-*Ixodes* ticks (dog ticks, lone star ticks, etc.) are **zero-risk** for Lyme disease (though they carry other diseases). So identifying the tick is step one. If it’s not the blacklegged tick, Lyme isn’t a concern from that bite.
* *Geography (Infection rate):* In the Northeast/Midwest, on the order of 20–50% of adult blacklegged ticks and 15–30% of nymphs may carry *B. burgdorferi*, whereas in southern or western areas infection rates are often <10%. So where the tick came from matters. A bite in coastal Connecticut is riskier than one in Florida, for example.
* *Attachment Duration:* Ticks do not transmit Lyme immediately. Lab and field studies show minimal transmission in the first \~24 hours of feeding, with risk rising sharply after \~36–48 hours of attachment. The CDC notes that most Lyme transmissions require the tick feeding for **at least 36–48 hours**. Thus, a promptly removed tick (attached only a few hours) is very unlikely to transmit infection. Conversely, a fully engorged tick (indicating a days-long blood meal) that is from a high-prevalence area has a non-trivial chance of causing illness – experts like Dr. Thomas Mather (Univ. of Rhode Island) estimate up to \~1 in 2 in the very worst case scenarios. Indeed, Mather states *“the chance of catching Lyme from an individual tick ranges from zero to roughly 50%, depending on three factors: the tick species, where it came from, and how long it was feeding”*.

In practice, these bite-level risk factors are used informally by clinicians and in services like TickEncounter’s “tick expert” feedback. TickEncounter (URI) is a program where people can submit photos of their tick and details of the bite; experts respond with an assessment of Lyme risk and advice. For example, in one case a client found a deer tick attached for 3 days in a Pennsylvania county – TickEncounter deemed it “high risk” (and indeed recommended medical follow-up). In another case, a woman found a barely attached American dog tick – experts reassured her that her Lyme risk was essentially nil. This shows that while no *widely adopted automated calculator* exists, the underlying logic is being applied on a case-by-case basis by experts. The limitation here is lack of standardization: risk communication depends on individual expertise, and not all patients have access to an entomologist’s input. It also can be subjective (e.g. “tick was attached \~overnight” is an estimate). A formal model or tool that quantitatively combines these factors could bring more consistency.

**Tick Testing Services:** Another piece of the puzzle, though not a “model” per se, is the availability of tick testing (labs that will identify the tick species and test the removed tick for *Borrelia* and other pathogens). Some state public health labs or commercial labs (e.g. UMass **TickReport**, NJ **Ticknology**) offer this. When a tick is tested, it directly informs risk: a positive *Borrelia*-PCR in the tick indicates a higher infection likelihood (as Hofhuis et al. showed, presence of *Borrelia* DNA in the tick increased infection odds several-fold). A negative test, while not a 100% guarantee, is very reassuring – many physicians consider that essentially a near-zero risk if the tick carried no Lyme bacteria. The strength here is personalization: it’s specific to *that exact tick*. Limitations include cost, time (results might take days, during which prophylaxis decisions need to be made), and variable quality of labs. There’s also the nuance that a tick could test positive but still not transmit (especially if removed early). Thus, tick testing is a tool often used in conjunction with risk models, not a standalone predictor. No unified public health tool currently takes a tick test result and automatically computes a percentage risk for the patient – that interpretation is left to doctors or the individual, guided by research findings like those above.

In summary, bite-level risk assessment is grounded in well-established factors and there are peer-reviewed models quantifying those. However, existing tools are mostly in the form of **expert guidelines or academic papers** rather than interactive public calculators. This suggests an opportunity to create a robust model (possibly Bayesian) that formally combines these elements for individual risk forecasting.

## Integrated Approaches Combining Environment and Individual Factors

A key question is whether any existing systems **combine ecological surveillance data with personal exposure models**. In other words, do we have a tool that knows both “how risky is this environment?” and “what was the nature of *your* exposure?” and merges them to produce a tailored risk estimate? This kind of integration is still in its infancy, but there are steps in that direction:

**One Health “Integrated” Risk Mapping:** A recent example from Canada shows how human behavior data can be merged with ecological risk maps. Bouchard *et al.* (2023) introduced an integrated Lyme risk model for southern Quebec that combines **social-behavioral factors** with **tick encounter risk**. They recognized that *“risk maps... rarely take into account the ability of the human public to adopt preventive behaviors, which represents a critical gap”*. To fill this gap, they gathered survey data on people’s knowledge and tick bite prevention behaviors in each area, and combined it with long-term tick surveillance data (ticks collected and infection rates). Using spatial statistics (including an Empirical Bayes smoothing of the behavior index), they produced **enhanced risk maps** highlighting areas where high tick hazard coincides with low usage of protective behaviors. They even created a spatial tool to test how different factors contribute to risk in each locale. The result was a *prioritization index* map to guide interventions – for example, a municipality with abundant infected ticks *and* low public awareness might be a priority for targeted education. **Strengths:** This is a true One Health approach, acknowledging that Lyme risk is a product of both environmental exposure and human behavior. It moves toward a more complete risk model by integrating data streams. **Limitations:** The model operates at a community level (municipality/region); it’s not providing a person-specific probability for a given tick bite. It’s more about **where to intervene** broadly. Also, it was a pilot in one region – not yet a widespread public tool. Nonetheless, it underscores that combining ecological and personal factors is feasible and valuable. To our knowledge, no U.S. public dashboard yet incorporates human behavior or personal exposure data into its Lyme risk maps – most focus on ticks and cases alone. This suggests room for advancement in U.S. tools by adopting similar integrated approaches.

**Smartphone Apps and Crowdsourcing:** There have been efforts to engage the public via apps – for example, the **Tick App** (developed by Columbia University and University of Wisconsin) is a citizen science tool to collect data on tick exposures and personal behaviors. Users log daily activities and any tick encounters, allowing researchers to analyze how behavior (like yard work, hiking, use of repellent) correlates with tick bites. While the Tick App improves understanding of exposure risk factors and could eventually inform personalized risk recommendations, currently it’s more of a data-gathering and awareness tool than a risk calculator. In Switzerland, developers of a “Swiss Tick” app have mentioned working on a *“spatio-temporal model for tick hazard”* to include in the app, which indicates an intention to give users location-specific tick risk forecasts. This is still emerging technology and not yet mainstream in the U.S. context. The potential is clear: an app could in theory cross-reference a user’s GPS location (and regional tick infection data) with their reported tick bite details to generate a risk estimate on the fly. As of 2025, we did not find a fully realized example of this in the U.S., reflecting a gap between the available data and user-facing risk tools.

**Personalized Risk Calculators (Proposed):** The idea of a Bayesian/geospatial per-bite risk model fits into this integration theme. Such a model would likely take prior probabilities from geography (e.g. “in this county, \~25% of nymph ticks carry Lyme, so prior probability tick was infected = 0.25”) and update them with personal evidence (tick attached X hours, was Y life stage, etc.) to output a posterior probability of infection. This is essentially an application of Bayes’ theorem: combining population risk with case-specific data. For example, using Bayes one could calculate: *P(Lyme | tick bite details)* = *P(tick was infected | location)* × *P(transmission | tick infected, attachment time)*. Many of the pieces for this are known in literature (as reviewed above). Yet, no standard tool has packaged them together for consumers or clinicians. The **closest analogues** are the expert systems and guidelines which we described – but those aren’t automated or quantitatively precise.

Notably, even the most advanced public maps and dashboards stop short of connecting to individual exposures. The Johns Hopkins dashboard team explicitly stated their focus is on mapping and data sharing, and while they contextualize disease with environment, they did not incorporate personal risk modeling. CDC’s tools like the Tick Bite Data Tracker (which monitors ER visits for tick bites) provide valuable surveillance info but again do not compute infection odds for those bites. Thus, a **Bayesian geospatial per-bite risk model would indeed be novel** in the U.S. landscape. It would represent a new level of decision-support tool, translating multi-source data into a patient-specific risk metric.

## Novelty and Gaps: Is There Room for Advancement?

In reviewing the existing models and tools, it’s evident that each covers part of the problem:

* **Ecological and Geographic Models:** Excellent for identifying high-risk areas and periods, using rigorous statistical and mapping methods. However, these models don’t personalize risk – they assume a generic person in that area.
* **Individual Bite Risk Models:** Provide probabilities based on specific tick bite parameters, grounded in empirical data. But they typically ignore geography (except in a crude way, like “endemic vs non-endemic region”) and exist mostly as guidelines or research, not interactive tools.
* **Integrated Approaches:** Very promising but so far limited to research pilots. Human behavior is rarely incorporated in risk models – Bouchard et al. call this a *“critical gap”* that they only begin to address. No widely adopted platform yet merges the personal and the ecological in real time.

Given this, there is **ample room for scientific advancement and standardization**. A Bayesian geospatial per-bite model could be pioneering in several ways:

* **Combining Data Streams:** It would formally merge tick surveillance data (infection rates, densities by location and season) with clinical and behavioral data (e.g. tick attachment time, use of protective measures) to generate a single risk estimate. This holistic approach is currently unmatched by existing tools. It could leverage the wealth of surveillance data now available (for instance, CDC’s county-level infected tick data) and personal tick bite inputs.
* **Quantifying Uncertainty:** Bayesian modeling naturally provides a probability distribution, acknowledging uncertainty in the estimate. This would be an upgrade from the yes/no or low/medium/high categorizations often used today. For example, instead of saying “prophylaxis is recommended” as a binary, a Bayesian model might output “estimated infection risk 5% (with 95% credible interval 2–8%).” This could standardize decision thresholds in a transparent way.
* **Personalized Decision Support:** Such a tool could guide both physicians and patients. Right now, one clinician’s idea of “high risk tick bite” might differ from another’s. A standardized model could reduce guesswork and make post-bite Lyme prevention more evidence-based. It would essentially formalize expert heuristics (like Dr. Mather’s three-factor rule) into a reproducible calculation.

However, challenges to this approach should be noted. Any model is only as good as the data and assumptions it’s built on. Variation in local tick infection rates, uncertainties in patient-reported attachment time, and individual host factors (like immune response) all complicate the picture. A Bayesian framework would allow incorporating such uncertainties, but it also means the outputs must be interpreted with care (a 5% risk does not guarantee safety, and a 0.5% risk is not zero). Moreover, user-friendly implementation is key – the average person or primary care doctor might not use a tool that is too complex or requires obscure inputs. Successful deployment would likely involve a simple interface (maybe a web form or app where one selects the state/county, tick type, engorgement level from a photo guide, hours attached, etc., and then gets a risk assessment).

**In conclusion,** existing Lyme risk models and tools each contribute valuable perspectives: spatial models map the environmental hazard, while bite-level analyses and clinical guidelines inform personal risk factors. Yet, they largely operate in isolation. We did not find any established tool that fully fuses *ecological surveillance data with individual exposure details* into a single risk calculation – indicating that a Bayesian geospatial per-bite risk model would be a **novel contribution** to the field. It would build upon prior research (as cited above) but offer a uniquely integrated and quantitative risk assessment. There is clear room for advancement and also for standardization: both the public and healthcare providers would benefit from more unified risk assessment methods. By drawing on the strengths of current models – the geographic breadth of surveillance dashboards and the granular predictive power of bite-level models – future systems can provide a more complete picture of Lyme disease risk. This would not only aid individual clinical decisions (e.g. whether to treat after a tick bite) but also improve public health messaging by aligning personal precautions with spatial risk realities. In the evolving landscape of tick-borne disease, such integrative approaches appear both necessary and innovative, filling gaps that current tools only partly address.
